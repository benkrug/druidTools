# druidTools
tools that help me with druid (starting with one, hopefully more in time)

The initial tool is a script to generate fake pseudo-random data to ingest, for testing purposes.

To start, it generates some fake "words" of different lengths, numbers of different sizes, and one coordinate point.  I save to a file and ingest with the spec.  

I'll be adding to it and refining it over time.  Hopefully, I'll add new kinds of data, and also have it automatically save to a file and use the API to load to a specified datasource.
